# Middie, the Sarcastic Chatbot

This project is a web application built with Streamlit, a Python library that allows you to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science. The app uses a Hugging Face model, specifically the `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` model, to generate text responses based on user input.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Streamlit
- Hugging Face Transformers

You can install the necessary libraries with pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers
```

## Usage

To start the app, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Functionality

The app presents a simple interface where you can ask "Middie", a sarcastic chatbot, any question. Middie's responses are generated by the `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` model, with a context prompt that brings out sarcastic replies.

## Deployment
